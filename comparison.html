<p>This page used to contain a comparison of various lossless audio codecs.
This page was however often out-of-date and like grading one's own exam:
no matter how it is presented, it will always appear biased.</p>

<p>Therefore, this comparison has been removed. For those interested,
there is a lot of discussion around various lossless audio codecs at
<a href="https://hydrogenaud.io/">Hydrogenaud.io</a>. It also has
<a href="https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Lossless_comparison">a
wiki page</a> comparing lossless codecs.</p>
