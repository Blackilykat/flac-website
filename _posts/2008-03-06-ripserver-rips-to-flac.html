title: Ripserver rips to FLAC
---

Ripfactory has announced the Ripserver, a sleek NAS with a slot-loading CD drive.  Pop in a CD and it automatically rips to FLAC or MP3 and adds it to the media library.  Ripserver can also run Slimserver and Twonkymedia for easy integration with Slim Devices, Sonos and many other networked media players.
