title: Volvo's Digital Jukebox plays FLAC
---

Want some FLAC with your Volvo?  Volvo's Digital Jukebox, developed with PhatNoise, is fully integrated with the car's audio system and available for the S60, V70, XC70, and S80. PhatNoise's PhatBox in 2002 was the first device to support FLAC natively and has gained a loyal following.  The Digital Jukebox and PhatBox also support Ogg Vorbis.
