title: New FLAC portables
---

It's time again for a bunch of new FLAC-supporting portables: the one-of-a-kind Pacemaker pocket-sized DJ system by Tonium, Garmin's nuvi 800 series nav systems with built-in audio player functionality, Latte's Ice, Gemei's X-590 and X-900, the Onda VX868, and finally one from SAFA.
