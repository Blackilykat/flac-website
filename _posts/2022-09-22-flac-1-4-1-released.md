title: FLAC 1.4.1 released
---

This release mostly fixes a few build system changes compared to FLAC 1.4.0. The reason this release follows 1.4.0 so quickly is because the 1.4.0 release tarball had emtpy man pages in it, which weren't being rebuilt without user intervention.

See the [changelog]({{ '/changelog.html' | relative_url }}) for more information.
