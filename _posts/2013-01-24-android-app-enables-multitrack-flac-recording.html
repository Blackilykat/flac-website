eXtream Software Development has released a stand-alone app for Android devices titled USB Audio Recorder PRO. Itâ€™s a simple record and playback application that is the first to allow devices running Android 3.1 or higher to talk to a USB 1.0 or 2.0 compliant audio card, and vice-versa. It is able to record to WAV, FLAC and OGG Vorbis on the go.
