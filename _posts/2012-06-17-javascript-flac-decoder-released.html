title: Javascript FLAC decoder released
---

Developers from Official.fm have built a nice piece of javascript-code that is able to decode FLAC-files. The code can be used to feed FLAC-data to the 'web-audio' API which is to be included in the HTML5 standard. This would enable FLAC-driven DJ-apps or audioeditors with HTML5.
