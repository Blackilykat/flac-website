title: Astell & Kern AK100 with FLAC support
---

At $699 not your average media player, but this Astell & Kern AK100 from iRiver Japan comes with support for WAV, FLAC, APE, OGG Vorbis and of course MP3 and stands out for being able of playing 192kHz/24-bit files, the latter being only possible when using either WAV of FLAC as file format. Beside using it as a (portable) media player, it can be used as DAC as well
