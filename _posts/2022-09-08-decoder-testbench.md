---

Besides the libraries and tools provided here, there are many
independently implemented encoders and decoders of the FLAC format. To
help developers of FLAC decoders to improve their product,
[a set of conformance test files](https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/flac-test-files)
can be found at github under the name FLAC decoder testbench.
