		The FLAC source code has several small example programs that demonstrate how to use the libraries.  The source is available on the <a href="download.html">download page</a>, or can be <a href="https://github.com/xiph/flac">checked out from git</a> or <a href="https://github.com/xiph/flac/tree/master/examples">browsed online</a>.  The examples complement the <a href="api/index.html">API documentation</a>.<br />
		<br />
		Currently the examples show how to encode WAV files to FLAC and vice-versa using both libFLAC and libFLAC++.  Over time we'll be adding more examples.
